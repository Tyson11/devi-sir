## Welcome
Hi! Welcome to my blog. I guess you are here because you too share my belief that formal methods can be used for fun and profit.  

I am interested in teaching formal methods, to both undergraduate and Master's students. I am of the view that we should introduce students to rigorous methods of programming, very early - in the first programming course they take. Applying formal techniques is not at all hard. It only takes initial effort to think more clearly about programs. With practice, rigor becomes second nature.

## Contacting me
If you wish to invite me to speak at your institute or organization, send an email to `dischargedpremise` at `gmail` dot `com`. If you wish to learn more about formal methods, *or* intend to introduce undergraduate or Master's courses in your institute, I'd be glad to help you in shaping the course.

It is quite possible that you may find some of my <a href="https://github.com/dischargedpremise" target="_blank">other work</a> useful.
