## Hello, World!
After weeks of deliberation and procrastination, I finally embraced GitHub Pages.

I intend to post articles about *formal methods*, and their application in software verification. I am of the view that contemporary techniques for formal verification of software are quite mature, at least in a reasonable number of domains. I strongly believe that the time is ripe *right now* for us to incorporate formal methods in undergraduate engineering curriculum, in India.

I draw inspiration from the wonderful exposition in [Verified software: theories, tools, experiments][TonyHoare]. The authors argue persuasively, make insightful observations, and ask important questions (in section 5 of the article):  

>The teams of experimental scientists will require education in the relevant theories, and training in the use of the best available tools. Would you be prepared to design and deliver Master’s courses on program verification? Would it be appropriate to set Master’s projects to verify small portions of the challenge material held in the repository?

In the past year (2016, that is), I took this vision upon myself (in a small way), and made a few modest attempts in spreading awareness about formal methods in various engineering institutes around Mangalore and Udupi. I shall narrate my experiments, and their outcomes, in the future posts.

Before closing, I must mention the invigorating effect [**The First Indian SAT+SMT School**] [SAT+SMT] had on me. It was organized by [Ashutosh Gupta][1] and [Supratik Chakraborty][2], and was hosted in the serene premises of TIFR, Mumbai (December 4-10, 2016). There were brilliant speakers and motivated participants. I intend to write more about it in a subsequent post.

So, see you soon!
